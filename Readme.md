# Stock Market Data Analysis Assignment #

Stock Market Data Analysis Assignment
In this assignment, you will work with Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform analysis and visualization of stock market data. The assignment consists of a Python script with several functions, each addressing a specific aspect of data analysis.

**Note**: Before you start, it's essential to understand the entire script and what each function does. Also, make sure to refer to the documentation of the relevant libraries for any functions or methods you are unfamiliar with.

## Background ##

Monte Carlo simulations can be a powerful tool for predicting stock prices and assessing risk. To learn more about Monte Carlo simulations check out this [article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp). 

## Instructions ##

### Understanding the Code: ### 
Begin by thoroughly examining the provided Python script, stock_analysis.py. Read through the code to understand its structure and purpose. Pay close attention to the comments and code comments (TODO sections) throughout the script.

**Complete the TODO Sections:** Within the script, there are several TODO comments indicating tasks that you need to complete. These tasks require you to write code or provide explanations based on your understanding of the code and data analysis concepts. Make sure to address each TODO in the script.

### Required Tasks: ###

Implement the missing code for calculating standard deviation and median in the basic_statistics(data) function.

Complete the code to **label** the x and y axes in the *visualize_trend(data)* function.

Fill in the missing values for **max_price** and **min_date** in the *extreme_values(data)* function.

Calculate and **print** the **average trading volume** for a specific time period in the *average_volume(data, start_date, end_date)* function.

**Print** the **top N days with the highest trading volume** in the *top_volume_days(data, n)* function.

Implement code to calculate and print the daily percentage change in stock prices in the *daily_percentage_change(data)* function.

Monte Carlo Simulation: The script includes a Monte Carlo simulation function called *monte_carlo_simulation(data, num_simulations, num_days)*. This function is commented out by default. If you want to challenge yourself, uncomment this function and implement the missing code to perform a Monte Carlo simulation for predicting future stock prices. 
Ensure you understand the concepts involved in the simulation.
